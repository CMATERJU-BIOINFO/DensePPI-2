EnMAS, an innovative substitution matrix-based deep learning approach for identifying interacting protein pairs. BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix (BLOSUM) and Point Accepted Mutation (PAM) matrices are usually used to score amino acid peptide sequence alignment between evolutionary divergent and closely related species. Contrary to the random colour generation approach in DensePPI, the mutation rate of amino acids in a protein sequence over long evolutionary time scales from these substitution matrices are used to generate 2D images from the amino acid sequences of the interacting proteins. A variation of the Convolution Neural Network, DenseNet201 is used for the training and classification of these images. The performance is evaluated on both benchmarked datasets _JUPPI_ and _Saccharomyces Cerevisiae_ (S.cerevisiae). The proposed model, EnMAS, demonstrates an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 97.35\% when applied to the _S. cerevisiae_ dataset, marking an improvement of 1.57\% compared to the best existing methods. Furthermore, EnMAS outperforms the most recent sequence-based approaches on the JUPPI dataset, considering the complexities of the pair input method across distinct test classes of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The enhanced performance on diverse test sets proves the efficiency of the bio-inspired sequence to image colour encoding strategy using the substitution matrices.
